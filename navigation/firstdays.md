## Getting tools setup
I had most of my tools already set up, but I then had to reinstall some of them through WSL. This was probably the easiest part of the week.

## Portflio & Student_2025
I git cloned the portfolio and student git repos, but got confused when I tried to run scripts through the student_2025 repo, when they were actually in the portfolio_2025 repository.

## Helping people
I helped my friend and partned Jacob set up his coding enviornment and helped other people with editing their website.

## First Big Problem
Whenever I would save a change to index.html, it would end up being reverted when running make. I still don't have this issue fixed.
