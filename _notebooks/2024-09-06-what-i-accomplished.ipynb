My github repositories are an archive of my accomplishments, one of my notebooks contains commands and things I did to set up my Sprints, and my notebook of my completed homework and popcorn hacks shows my completion of classwork and preparedness for the next learning content.

My biggest contribution in class was asking meaningful questions, and clarifying things in the lessons that we were learning.

Another one my contributions was staying up very late helping Ahmad fix his images, however most of that time was me waiting for him to finish removing spaces from file names.\n",

For example, you can use the modulo to see if a number is even or odd and to limit a value. Another thing I learned was how to do if/elif/else statements in Python. I also learned the different cases in coding and what language each of them are used in.\n",
