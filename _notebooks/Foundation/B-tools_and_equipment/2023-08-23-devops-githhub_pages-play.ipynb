    "## GitHub Pages Coding Introduction \n",
    "Building the entire frontend GitHub Pages web application requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GitHub Pages has built-in support for an additional content language called Markdown, which is a shorthand complement to HTML. Markdown is focused on creating static content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML** is responsible for the content\n",
    "- **Markdown** is a shorthand way of writing content\n",
    "- **CSS** adds styling to the web page content\n",
    "- **JavaScript** adds functionality and interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In GitHub Pages, Jekyll serves as the build framework. It takes our choice of theme specified in the `_config.yml` file, along with our Markdown, HTML, and notebook files, to construct a complete static website. A significant portion of the frontend design work has already been done for users through the selection and use of a theme; this greatly reduces the need to code in CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jekyll converts Markdown (.md) files into HTML. Behind the scenes of GitHub Pages, Jekyll and the Liquid programming language build and programmatically construct each Markdown file into a specific web page. Markdown provides a straightforward way to start with GitHub Pages development. **In a Markdown file, you can exclusively use Markdown syntax or incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** based on your expertise and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Static Content?\n",
    "Static content refers to web pages that are delivered to the user's browser exactly as stored, without any server-side processing or dynamic content generation. This means the content remains the same for every user and does not change unless the source files are manually updated. Static websites are typically faster, more secure, and easier to deploy compared to dynamic websites, which require server-side processing to generate content on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Dynamics to GitHub Pages\n",
    "Through the use of JavaScript and the fetch of data through APIs (backed by servers), developers are able to customize GitHub Pages to support data change. As we explore the portfolio_2025, we will see JavaScript games, login systems, and data that appear very dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nighthawk Pages\n",
    "While this introduction covers the basics of creating static content with GitHub Pages, our classroom GitHub Pages will delve deeper into more advanced topics. We will explore how to integrate dynamic content, use advanced JavaScript techniques, and leverage APIs to create more interactive and engaging web pages.\n",

    "The `script` tag in the running example above contains JavaScript. This JavaScript is written in a style that is similar to other languages like Java and Python, making it easier for developers familiar with those languages to understand. However, be aware that code can be written in many styles, some of which may not be as friendly to the syntax of other coding languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is unique in its `style` and `html` usages that are shown in this example. The interaction of JavaScript with these tags and its operation within a web browser is its unique purpose. As JavaScript and other languages develop their niches, they start to vary in aspects like syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pure JavaScript programmer might write the `script` section differently. Therefore, when you watch a coding video or request code from a chatbot, the code might vary, but the different coding styles and syntax changes essentially achieve the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connecting to the HTML Container**:\n",
    "   - The `container` declaration connects to the HTML element with the ID `grid_container`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Data**:\n",
    "   - The `http_source` holds the base URL for the flag images.\n",
    "   - The `living_in_the_world` array contains objects representing different locations, each with a flag URL, greeting, and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Building Grid Items**:\n",
    "   - The loop iterates over each location in the `living_in_the_world` array.\n",
    "   - For each location, a new `div` element with the class `grid-item` is created.\n",
    "   - An `img` element is created for the flag, with the `src` attribute set to data from the `living_in_the_world` array.\n",
    "   - Two `p` elements are created for the description and greeting.\n",
    "   - These elements are appended to the `gridItem` div, which is then appended to the `container` div.\n",

    "### Modern JavaScript Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates several modern JavaScript features that are prevalent in contemporary JavaScript codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`const` for Variable Declarations**: The `const` keyword is used for variable declarations, indicating that the variable's value will not change throughout the script. This is useful for defining constants and ensuring immutability.\n",
    "- **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions are used in the `forEach` loop. They provide a concise syntax for writing functions and are popular in functional programming styles.\n",
    "- **Template Literals**: Template literals are used for string concatenation. They allow for embedding expressions within strings using backticks (`` ` ``) and `${}` syntax. This can make the code more readable and easier to write by keeping the evaluation and the string in close proximity, reducing the cognitive load on the developer.\n",
