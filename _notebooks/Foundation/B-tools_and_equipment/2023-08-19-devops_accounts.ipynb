    "## Personal Identifiable Information (PII)\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating accounts for this course, it's important to understand what personal identifiable information (PII) is and how and what to protect. PII includes any information that can be used to identify you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, in some cases we will ask you share or build the value PII.  We hope to do it in a good way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PII Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites like `LinkedIn` are places where we want to showcase our accomplishments. We intend to advertise PII.\n",
    "\n",
    "As individuals and a society, sometimes we are willing spread our PII through sites like TikTok, Reddit, X, Instagram or Facebook. This often provides satisfaction, some refer to it as the dopamine effect.  Sometimes we are proud of what we advertise, sometime us or others wish they could retract the information shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our society, all the accounts mentioned above become part of our PII.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of PII\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Public Information**: These are details that are generally known and shared:\n",
    "  - Name\n",
    "  - Email (consider using a secondary email)\n",
    "  - Picture\n",
    "  - High School and College attended\n",
    "  - Properties you own\n",
    "  - State and City of residence\n",
    "  - Previous residences\n",
    "  - Credit Reports\n",
    "  - Home router location\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensitive Information**: Be more cautious with these details:\n",
    "  - Full birth date\n",
    "  - Place of Birth\n",
    "  - Street Address\n",
    "  - Phone Number\n",
    "  - Maiden names of Mother or Grandmother\n",
    "  - Driver's License Number\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Highly Confidential Information**: Keep these absolutely secret:\n",
    "  - Internet Access Credentials\n",
    "  - Google key store\n",
    "  - Two-Factor Authentication sources\n",
    "  - Social Security Number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques to Increase Security\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use systems that require a code sent to your phone or email.\n",
    "* **Biometrics**: Secure your devices with fingerprints or facial recognition.\n",
    "* **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Understand that public-key cryptography uses a pair of keys (one public, one private) to encrypt and decrypt messages. This is used in SSL for secure websites (aka https://).\n",
    "* **Strong Passwords**: Use complex and unique passwords for different accounts. Consider using a password manager to keep track of them.\n",
    "* **Regular Software Updates**: Keep your operating system, applications, and antivirus software up to date to protect against the latest threats.\n",
    "* **Secure Home Router**: Create a strong password for your home router to ensure it is not easily compromised from the internet.\n",
    "* **Secure Wi-Fi**: Use strong passwords for your home Wi-Fi network to ensure it is not easily accessed by others in proximity (e.g., the stree). Consider using a VPN when accessing Wi-Fi in public places (e.g., coffee shops).\n",
    "* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data on your devices and backups to protect it from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be Aware of Internet Threats\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Viruses and Malware**: These compromise security and are often spread through email attachments.\n",
    "* **Phishing**: Be cautious of attempts to get your information through deceptive emails or websites.\n",
    "* **Social Engineering**: Be aware of tactics used to manipulate you into divulging confidential information.\n",
    "* **Post-Incident Actions**: If compromised, review and secure all vulnerabilities immediately. Revise and update your PII plan to prevent future incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and protecting your PII, you can safely navigate the digital world and keep sensitive and highly confidentail personal information secure."

    "## Nighthawk Coders Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will advise you to create several accounts. Additionally, we will request that you publish a public-facing name and email on some of these accounts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Email Accounts\n",
    "You will be using and sharing email accounts with the teacher and fellow students.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy I employ is maintaining different email accounts according to the expected type or volume of information (junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This is not about security, but it helps set an expectation for the \"purpose,\" \"value,\" or \"importance\" of information aggregated to that endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Account\n",
    "We want you to create a GitHub account. You will need to establish a GitHub user ID, username, and email. This can include one or more email accounts. We will ask that you make a name and email public. This account will be your social media account as a coder.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest that you use a \"junk\" or \"common\" email account for this platform. We recommend that you don't use your school email.\n",
    "\n",
    "The email you make public should be in the same category as what you would share on more professional social media accounts, i.e., in the \"common\" or \"junk\" category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Pages\n",
    "We will ask you to publish a Student Portfolio using GitHub Pages. This will be a public website and will be indexed by Google and Google Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slack Account\n",
    "We will ask you to create an account on Slack, which will require PII. We suggest that you use a \"junk\" or \"common\" email account for this platform. We recommend that you don't use your school email.\n",
    "\n",
    "PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled. There are different Slack workspaces for CSSE, CSP, and CSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portfolio 2025 Account\n",
    "We will ask you to create a user account based on your GitHub user ID. This will be used to build course lists, provide compute services (e.g., AWS, KASM), and aggregate analytics for the teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled."

    "## PII Strategy on Account Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in the teacher's interest that you establish and continually refine your PII (Personal Identifiable Information) strategy. It is likely that you are already active in sharing common PII, considering for yourself what is OK to share. As you progress in the digital world, you will likely need to adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorize Information**: \n",
    "   - **Public Information**: Information you are comfortable sharing publicly, such as your name and general interests.\n",
    "   - **Sensitive Information**: Information that should be shared cautiously, such as your full birth date and phone number.\n",
    "   - **Highly Confidential Information**: Information that should be kept strictly private, such as your social security number and internet access credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Different Email Accounts**: \n",
    "   - Maintain different email accounts for different purposes (e.g., junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This helps manage the type and volume of information you receive and sets expectations for the importance of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Be Prepared for Security Incidents**: \n",
    "   - Anticipate that you may be hacked and will need to secure any vulnerabilities. Regularly update your passwords and use multi-factor authentication where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adapt and Evolve**: \n",
    "   - As you gain more experience and your digital footprint grows, continually reassess and adapt your PII strategy to ensure it remains effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parting Advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you create and manage your accounts, always be mindful of the information you are sharing. Protecting your PII is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and adaptability. By categorizing your information, using different email accounts, and preparing for potential security incidents, you can better safeguard your personal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the digital world is constantly evolving, and so should your approach to managing your PII. Stay informed about the latest security practices and be proactive in protecting your digital identity. Your future self will thank you for the precautions you take today."
