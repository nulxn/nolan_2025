    "\n",
    "### Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Take note and describe the type of shell commands you are using through Terminal in this installation procedure.** This is specific to your machine.\n",
    "  - Examples: `wsl`, `cd`, `git`, `apt`, `brew`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In the development process, developers use version control. Annotate in your notes what you have learned about version control during this setup process.**\n",
    "  - How are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine? How do you navigate to those files?\n",
    "  - How are the files updated in GitHub? How do you navigate to those files?\n",
    "  - How would you update your template of the `student_2025` repository? How would you make it more applicable to your specific course?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Localhost vs. Deployed Server\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Put into words the difference between viewing GitHub Pages running on your localhost machine versus running on a deployed server.**\n",
    "  - What is the localhost URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?\n",
    "  - What is the GitHub Pages URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS and GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DNS is the address manager for the internet. Reflect on the following questions:**\n",
    "  - Is there a domain on your GitHub Pages?\n",
    "  - Is the URL for your GitHub Pages different from your neighbors' URLs? Did you change the URL? If so, when?\n",
