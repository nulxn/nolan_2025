    "- **Laptop Requirement**: Ensure you have a laptop with development tools installed. MacOS and Windows are preferred. Chromebooks are supported by using a KASM cloud workspace.\n",
    "- **Version Control**: GitHub will store your coding projects and serve as a collaboration hub with others.\n",
    "- **Code Editor**: This course will use Visual Studio Code for its extensive support for programming languages and helpful coding features.\n",
    "- **Interactive Coding**: In this course, coding will be interactive and instantaneous. Visual Studio Code, with support for Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub Pages, is ideal for coding, data analysis, capturing notes, and creating documentation.\n",
    "- **Web Hosting**: Throughout this course, students and teachers will publish their projects and notes using GitHub pages. Students will showcase their projects and chronicle their development journey.\n",
    "- **Application Containerization**: Using tools like GitHub Pages, Docker, and AWS, students will learn to create, deploy, and run applications on the Internet.\n",
    "- **Communication and Collaboration**: Stay updated and connected with course announcements and discussions using Slack. The DM, group messages, and channel communication options allow students to stay informed and collaborate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these tools, you'll be well-equipped to tackle various projects and collaborate efficiently with your peers. Future topics will delve deeper into advanced tools and techniques to further enhance your development skills."

    "- **GitHub Portal**: Create an account on GitHub. It will be used to store, plan, track, and publish your coding projects.\n",
    "- **MacOS Tools**: Use the Terminal with the Homebrew `brew` command for installing developer tools on MacOS.\n",
    "- **Windows Tools**: Use the Terminal with the `wsl` command to set up a Linux shell. Use the `apt` command within that shell for installing developer tools on Ubuntu.\n",
    "- **KASM Cloud Tools**: Become familiar with the Linux shell. Use the `apt` command to review installed developer tools on Ubuntu.\n",
    "- **Visual Studio Code and Marketplace**: Get comfortable with the Visual Studio Code editor and explore marketplace extensions to enhance your coding experience.\n",
    "- **JavaScript, Python, Java**: Learn the Development Life Cycle and get introduced to Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- **Python Packages**: Learn to use the `pip` command in the Terminal to add Python libraries to your projects. Libraries are pre-written code shared by others.\n",
    "- **Java Packages**: Understand how to use the `pom.xml` configuration file to add third-party libraries to your Java projects."
