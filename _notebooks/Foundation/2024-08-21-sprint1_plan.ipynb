    "## Project-base Learning Requirements\n",
    "Each sprint there will be hacks and project-based learning requirements.  It is up to the individual to develop their own plan for how they will represent work.  Here are some links and tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All work, tangible artifacts, will be captured in personal GitHub Pages\n",
    "- Tools and Software Development requirements are foundational requirements for all the CompSci courses.  Thus, they are shared, but listed under [CSSE Projects](https://github.com/orgs/nighthawkcoders/projects/15)\n",
    "- To obtain clarity on instructions you should start by picking a post in Sprint 1, then ask questions.  \n",
    "- In Agile Development methodology, which we will learn throughout the course, an iteration (plans, designs, review references, coding) and questions should all be considered as part of your work.\n",
    "- Since iteraction and questions are part of your work, you should consider capturing and outlining iterations and questions in your blog.\n",
    "- Be aware, you will get more \"Points\" if you \"Indicate\" that you are progressing on a CompSci journey.  \n",
    "- There are very few \"Correct Answers\" in this class! As you code, you will see that there is always more bugs and features.\n"

    "- Code, Code, Code.  This is the process of making code and involves making plans, designs, reviewing references, asking questions and Code-Code-Coding. \n",
    "- No paper. We will be learning to do all work electronically. \n",
    "- Work Talk. A very high percentate 75%, 80% or more of your talk during class should be code, code, code talk.\n",
    "- Ears that can listen.  100% of time you should be available for discussion.  Covered or plugged in ears restricts hearing.\n",
    "- Hands that can code. The primary coding device is assumed to be your laptop!  Sprint 1 will be focused on laptop importance.\n",
