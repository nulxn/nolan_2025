# Tri 2 Retrospective

## 5 Things over 12 Weeks

1. Learn how to make a **full-stack application** and use Flask on Python
2. Learn how **agile methodology** works and how the workflows of projects work
3. Learn how to write pull requests and about how the **git workflow works (PRs, git rebase, conflicts)**
4. Worked on my feature and project in an organized manner with **kanban boards**
5. Helped other people with their bugs, features, and issues

I also learned about how DNS, deployment, nginx, and HTTPS and domain certificates work. I also learned about docker and how linux groups and permissions work.

## CPT & Project

### Program Purpose and Function

- **Input:**
  - The user provides input through the text fields:
    ```js
    <input type="text" id="front" placeholder="Front" />
    <input type="text" id="back" placeholder="Back" />
    ```
  - The input is processed when the user clicks the "Create" button:
    ```js
    <button onclick="createNolan(front.value, back.value)">Create</button>
    ```
- **Program Functionality:**

  - The program allows users to create, update, delete, and flip flashcards.
  - Cards are created dynamically and stored in a backend database.

- **Output:**
  - The flashcards are displayed dynamically inside the `.cards` container:
    ```js
    function addCard(nolan) {
      const cards = document.querySelector(".cards");
      const card = document.createElement("div");
      card.classList.add("card");
      card.innerHTML = `<h3>${nolan.front}</h3>`;
    }
    ```

### Data Abstraction

- **List (or Collection Type) Usage:**

  - The program fetches an array (list) of flashcards from the backend:
    ```js
    fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/flashcards`, fetchOptions)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(async (nolans) => {
        nolans.forEach(addCard);
      });
    ```
  - Here, `nolans` is an array containing multiple flashcards.

- **Storing Data in the List:**

  - When a new flashcard is created, it is added to the backend:
    ```js
    function createNolan(front, back) {
      fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/flashcards`, {
        ...fetchOptions,
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({ front, back }),
      })
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then(addCard);
    }
    ```

- **Using the List to Fulfill the Program's Purpose:**
  - The stored flashcards are displayed dynamically:
    ```js
    nolans.forEach(addCard);
    ```
  - Each card is processed and displayed from the list.

### Managing Complexity

- **How the List Manages Complexity:**
  - Without the list, each flashcard would have to be manually created and managed.
  - The list allows for:
    - Easy retrieval and display of multiple flashcards.
    - A more scalable approach where adding more flashcards does not require additional code.
    - Simple iteration through the flashcards with `.forEach(addCard);`.

### Procedural Abstraction

- **Student-Developed Procedure with a Parameter:**

  - The `addCard(nolan)` function:
    ```js
    function addCard(nolan) {
      const card = document.createElement("div");
      card.classList.add("card");
      card.innerHTML = `<h3>${nolan.front}</h3>`;
    }
    ```
  - **Parameter:** `nolan` (an object containing the front and back of a flashcard).
  - **Effect of Parameter:** The function creates a flashcard dynamically based on the provided data.

- **Procedure Call:**
  - The function is called when flashcards are retrieved from the backend:
    ```js
    nolans.forEach(addCard);
    ```

### Algorithm Implementation

- **Algorithm with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration:**
  - **Sequencing:** The process of fetching and displaying flashcards follows a clear sequence.
  - **Selection:** Cards have an interactive flip mechanism:
    ```js
    card.addEventListener("click", () => {
      if (isFlipped) {
        card.innerHTML = `<h3>${nolan.front}</h3>`;
      } else {
        card.innerHTML = `<h3>${nolan.back}</h3><p>${nolan.front}</p>`;
      }
      isFlipped = !isFlipped;
    });
    ```
  - **Iteration:** Iterating through the flashcards to display them:
    ```js
    nolans.forEach(addCard);
    ```

### Testing

- **Two Different Calls to the Procedure:**

  - `addCard({ front: "What is 2+2?", back: "4" })`
  - `addCard({ front: "What is the capital of France?", back: "Paris" })`
  - These calls provide different arguments and create different cards.

- **Conditions Tested:**

  - Different flashcards should be displayed correctly.
  - The card flip function should correctly show/hide content.

- **Results Identified:**
  - Clicking a card should correctly toggle between front and back content.
  - The expected output (flashcards appearing and flipping correctly) is achieved.

## Looking Forward

| **Planning**                 | 0.19/0.2 | Strength             | I think that my group and I used our kanban boards and burndown lists well to plan our features. Figma designs also helped. The thing we could habe worked on was writing more on the issues in our kanban board, but that issue subsided as we improved throughout the trimester.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Creativity**               | 0.07/0.1 | Weakness             | I think that I can come up with creative ideas, such as the boom meter, however I do not do enough to implement them. Also my old feature (Nolan table) was very uncreative, and although my new flashcard feature is much better, it is still not very creative & can still be improved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Functionality**            | 0.28/0.3 | Strength             | I think that my code works as intended. I added checks on the frontend and most importantly the backend to not have breaking errors. I just need to make the edit menu a bit more user friendly (though that is the UX engineer's job)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Knowledge**                | 0.3/0.3  | Strength             | I think that I understand almost everything about full-stack works, applied the knowledge of database and SQL, and worked well in both frontend and backend. The thing I need to work on is the wording in the AP Test (FRQ) and the topics on the MCQ that we did not cover in class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Collaboration & Feedback** | 0.08/0.1 | Middle               | I think that I did a good job of taking feedback and then applying it to both my work and processes, such as asking questions. I think that I need to work on collaborating more with my teammates that don't do as well. I think that I can collaborate effectively with my teammates that have a good idea of what they're doing and don't need help besides bug fixing, however I need to work better with teammates who need more extensive help and need more in depth help. This means not doing the bulk of the work for them, and instead trying to have them write the code themselves but guiding them in the right direction. However, I think I got better at this as the trimester ended. |
| **Total**                    | 0.92     |                      |

###

During N@TM, I took interest in a chess feature. However, the feature did not include multiplayer. Because I liked it so much I decided to try and create my own implementation

**Link:** https://github.com/nulxn/chess

I think that my strengths are that I can do work and that I understand the material and can work within the framework of another project, however I think that I need to work on being able to teach my teammates more, instead of doing things for them on their computers. I also think that I need more patience.
