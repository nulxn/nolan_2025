# CrossWise Trimester Reflection

This trimester, working on **CrossWise** was a huge leap in both my technical skills and understanding of modern full-stack development. The project focused on analyzing and visualizing border crossing patterns using historical data and live feeds. I contributed to building interactive interfaces, managing complex data pipelines, and implementing facial recognition features‚Äîall while learning real-world practices used in industry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features I Helped Build

### ü§ñ Predictive ML System for Border Wait Times

- Parsed historical border crossing datasets (CSV, JSON).
- Built a simple machine learning pipeline to forecast future wait times.
- Applied preprocessing, trend analysis, and feature engineering to improve predictions.

### üîÅ Complex Data & Network Routing

- Coordinated frontend/backend communication for real-time updates.
- Structured data flow so the UI could reflect live predictions and user actions.
- Managed asynchronous data fetches and UI rendering states efficiently.

## üå± Personal Reflection

Before this project, I had mostly worked on Python scripts, basic web pages, and surface-level backend integration. CrossWise challenged me to build full systems that combined ML models, and interactive frontends.

I now understand how historical data can be cleaned, modeled, and used to inform predictions. I also gained experience integrating machine learning into an actual app‚Äînot just in theory. Facial recognition and React Native were both new to me, and working with biometric security and mobile-first UIs opened my eyes to how real apps are built today.

From handling complex data pipelines to designing clean user experiences, this project gave me practical insight into what it's like to work as a modern software developer.
